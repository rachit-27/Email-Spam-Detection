# Email-Spam-Detection
## We have created 4 models for detection.

##### In Model 1 we have used a dataset of approx 30000 entries and applied naive bayes algorithm.
##### In Model 2 we have used a dataset of approx 30000 entries, do some manual changes a created some spam into ham and applied naive bayes algorithm for comparision purpose with model 1.
##### In Model 3 we have used a dataset of approx 5000 entries and applied naive bayes algorithm.
##### In Model 4 we have used a dataset of approx 30000 entries and applied stacking to improve the accuracy of model.

##### After observing all models we see that the stackin model has better accuracy than all the other models
